\chapter{Web Backend}
The web backend is written in Flask and contains 3 routes.
analyze\_correct\_exams and analyze\_student\_exams receive the data as json.
The conversion should work with dataclasses\_json.
See "Frontend-Backend Communication" for details.

\section{analyze\_correct\_exams}
This is called when the user clicks "Submit" on the TaskSelector.
It expects an Exam\_container as input.
It analyzes the tasks in exam\_container.correct\_exam.tasks and fills the expected answer of all tasks with the analyzed answers.
It returns an exam\_container.

\section{analyze\_student\_exams}
This is called when the user clicks "next" in the TaskSelector.
It expects an Exam\_container as input.
It analyses exam\_container.student\_exams.tasks and compares it with the expected\_answers.
Also it writes the points.
It returns a exam\_container.
As an idea for further implementations this route should be rewritten.
It may be a good idea to change this route, so that it only analyze one exam time simultaneous, so it does not timeout.

\section{pdf2img}
This method is called when the user selects a pdf as an exam.
It will be converted to an image which will be returned afterwards.
