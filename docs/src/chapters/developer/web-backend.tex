\chapter{Web Backend}
The web backend is written in Flask and contains 3 routes.
analyze\_correct\_exams and analyze\_student\_exams take
their data as json. The conversion should work with
dataclasses\_json. See "Frontend-Backend Communication" for
details. 

\section{analyze\_correct\_exams}
This is called when the user clicks "Submit" on the
TaskSelector. It expects an Exam\_container as input. It
analyzes the tasks in exam\_container.correct\_exam.tasks
and fills the expected answer of all tasks with the
analyzed answers. It returns a exam\_container.

\section{analyze\_student\_exams}
This is called when the user clicks "next" in the
TaskSelector.  It expects an Exam\_container as input. It
analyzeses exam\_container.student\_exams.tasks and compares
it with the expected\_answers. Also it writes the points. It
returns a exam\_container.
It may be a good idea to change this route, so that it only
analyze one exam time simultanious, so it doasn't timeout.

\section{pdf2img}
This is called when the user selects an pdf for the
correct exam and chooses an pdf. It gets converted to an
image and returned.
