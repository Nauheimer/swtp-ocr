\chapter{Important Frontend Components}
\section{React Components}
The frontend is splitted in multiple React components.
First of all there are the Website is splitted in Footer App and Header.
Header and Footer are called from the App component\\

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Regions of the web application} %change caption
\end{figure}

The App renders three different views: TaskSelector, ReviewOverview, ReviewExam.
The App contains the "ExamContainer", the main state for the whole Application.

\section{TaskSelector Component}
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{taskselector}
    \caption{TaskSelector}
\end{figure}

The TaskSelector is splitted in a left and a right column.

\begin{figure}[H]
Props\\
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|} 
    \hline
    exam & The exam that should be viewed. Called only with
    examContainer.correctExam \\
    \hline
    setExam & setter for exam \\
    \hline
    examContainer & the whole examContainer state live at App\\
    \hline
    setExamContainer & setter for examContainer \\
    \hline
    setStudentExams & setter for examContainer.studentExams \\
    \hline
    leave & a function for leaving the examContainer and moving on in
    the Process. It changes a state in App \\
    \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Image Selection}
When a user selects an Image it is loaded and saved as base64
string in ExamContainer.correctExam.image.
When a user selects a pdf it will be sent to the backend where it gets
converted to a png file. Afterwards it is saved as base64 string in
ExamContainer.correctExam.image.

\subsection{CroppingArea}
Marked blue\\
The image in the Cropping area is exam.image.
The Cropping area uses a component called Cropper which is just a wrapper around ReactCrop from the library react-image-crop.

\subsection{Rectangle Component}
For every Task in examcontainer.correctExam.tasks there is a
Rectangle components, with x, y, width and height values.
It is just a div with css styling set so it has a red border and appears on the tasks selection.

Important: In a Task x, y, width, height are stored as integers and are relative to to original image.
Rectangle expects values relative to the cropping area.
This happens through a conversion.

\subsection{Add Button}
The Add takes the current crop from the croppingArea and creates a new Task in exam.tasks.

\subsection{TaskEditingAreas Component}
For each Task there is a TaskEditingArea.
