\chapter{Frontend-Backend Communication}

\section{ExamContainer and Exam\_Container}
The communication between front- and backend is realised with simple http requests.
The requests are filled with json data based on the information from the examContainer.
The backend fills the examContainer with data and sends it back.

\subsection{Conversion}
The ExamContainer class of the frontend and the Exam\_Container class of the backend have the same attributes.
The json data is written in CamelCase.
In the backend this will be converted by using the dataclasses\_json.
